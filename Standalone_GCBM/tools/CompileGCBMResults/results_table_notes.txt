v_disturbance_indicators
--
This table records actual area and carbon disturbed, in contrast with v_flux_indicators
where the area column records the total area of the classifier set, of which a disturbance
usually only affects a subset.

Pixels where a disturbance occurred but there were no associated fluxes do not have their
area recorded in v_disturbance_indicators, although the model tracks the total disturbed
area (fluxes or not) in DisturbanceDimension. An example of how this might happen is a
softwood pixel disturbed by an insect with only hardwood pools in its disturbance matrix.
