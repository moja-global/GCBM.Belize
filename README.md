## Technology Stack

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Installation and usage instructions on Windows

1. Clone the repository

2. Download the installation tools from releases: [install_tools](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Belize/releases/tag/install_tools), and unzip them into `Standalone_GCBM\tools` folder.

3. Follow the installation instructions, located in `Standalone_GCBM\README.md`

4. Modify the `Standalone_GCBM\run_all.bat` file to activate or deactivate the custom parameter modifications (explained below), as default, all custom configurations are enabled

4. Execute `run_all.bat`

This codebase was tested using a Windows 10 system, the `Standalone_GCBM\README.md` file contains further explanation on the GCBM usage, and tutorials on the model can be found in the moja.global [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQUrrNP1Xf-Fv4c8uHYXhQ)

## Custom configuration for Belize

This implementation of the GCBM includes several parameter changes, that were included to adapt the model to BelizeÂ´s local conditions

The `Standalone_GCBM\run_all.bat` file includes all the steps that were taken to adapt the model:

1. A custom Generic Tropical species in created `input_database\add_species_vol_to_bio.py` using a linear volume to biomass conversion factor and proportions of stem, bark, foliage and branches extracted from local literature. 

2. A custom set of root parameters (to convert from AGB to BGB) is applied `input_database\modify_root_parameters.py`

3. A set of decay parameters that was compiled from the scientific literature 
`input_database\custom_parameters\decay parameters.py` and is used to mofify the default ones 
`input_database\modify_decay_parameters.py`

4. A sensitive turnover parameter (tree mortality) was modified `input_database\modify_turnover_parameters.py`

5. The disturbance regime of the spinup procedure was changed to "Generic mortality 40%" every 10 years to reflect the effect of Hurricanes in Belize `input_database\modify_spinup_parameters.py`

Steps 3, 4 and 5 can be enabled/disabled in the run_all.bat file to perform a sensitivity analysis on the DOM pools

## Docker-based setup

1. Clone the `gcbm-container` branch of [GCBM.Belize](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Belize) using the command

      ```git clone -b gcbm-container https://github.com/moja-global/gcbm.belize```

2. Navigate into `GCBM.Belize` 

      ```cd gcbm.belize```

3. Use docker-compose to build the image

      ```docker-compose up -d```

4. Run the container using the command

      ``` docker exec -it gcbm-belize /bin/bash ```

5. Inside the running docker container, run 

      ```cd /server/gcbm_project```

6. Start the simulation using 

    ```/opt/gcbm/moja.cli --config_file gcbm_config.cfg --config_provider provider_config.json``` 

If there are existing images cached on your machine you may need to `docker pull ghcr.io/moja-global/rest_api_gcbm:master` and build the container using `docker-compose -d --force-recreate`

## Postprocessing and sensitivity analysis

Postprocessing codes using R are included in the Postprocessing folder for reference purposes.

If you are going to use this coded, we recommend to use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) version 4.1.2 and further install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Now open the `Postprocessing\GCBM_Belize_Sensitivity.Rproj` file, the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) package was used for library management, and a renv.lock file with the required packages is included

In order to perform sensitivity analysis, the Standalone_GCBM folder can be duplicated with another name (e.g. Standalone_GCBM_decaymod) and the run_all.bat can me modified and run. Then, the `Postprocessing\Summarize_DOM_Stocks.R` code has to be modified to generate graphs and tables with this new configuration (instructions in the code)
